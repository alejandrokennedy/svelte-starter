# ACS/C&EN Svelte Starter

**This is a downstream fork** of [The Pudding's Svelte Starter](https://github.com/the-pudding/svelte-starter), customized for American Chemical Society (ACS) and Chemical & Engineering News (C&EN) data journalism and visualization projects.

## Fork Maintenance Strategy

This fork uses a **Feature Branch Strategy** to stay synchronized with upstream changes:

- **`main` branch**: ACS/C&EN customizations (branding, chemistry-specific features, **uses pnpm**)
- **`pudding` branch**: Clean mirror of upstream for easy merging
- **Upstream sync**: Regular merging from The Pudding's repository to stay current with Svelte 5 migration and new features

### Step-by-Step Upstream Sync Process

#### 1. Update Main Branch with Upstream
```bash
# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Switch to main branch and merge upstream changes
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Push updated main to origin
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Safely Merge into ACS Branch
```bash
# Switch to acs-main and create a backup
git checkout acs-main
git branch acs-main-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Check what's coming in from main
git diff acs-main..main --stat
```

#### 3. Conservative Merge with Visual Conflict Resolution
```bash
# Initiate merge (this will create conflicts for manual control)
git merge main --no-ff
```

#### 4. Use Zed's Git Tools for Visual Resolution
- Open **Git Panel**: `git panel: toggle focus` or click Git icon
- Open **Project Diff**: `Ctrl+G D` / `Cmd+G D` for visual conflict resolution
- For each conflict:
  - **Prioritize acs-main changes** (logo, branding, config)
  - **Accept main's updates** for packages and dependencies
  - **Edit directly** in Project Diff multibuffer view
  - **Stage resolved hunks** with `Cmd+Y` / `Alt+Y`

#### 5. Handle Special Cases
- **Package files**: Accept main's versions with `git checkout --theirs package.json pnpm-lock.yaml`
- **Logo/branding**: Keep acs-main versions (your customizations)
- **package-lock.json**: Remove if present with `git rm package-lock.json` (acs-main uses pnpm)
- **Lock file regeneration**: Always run `pnpm install` after accepting `pnpm-lock.yaml` - this adapts the lock file to your platform (Mac ARM64 vs Linux x64) and ensures it matches your actual `node_modules`. Accept upstream's lock as a starting point, then regenerate for your environment.

#### 6. Complete the Merge
```bash
# Regenerate dependencies with pnpm
pnpm install

# Verify all conflicts resolved
git status

# Stage any updated lock files
git add pnpm-lock.yaml

# Commit the merge
git commit -m "Merge main branch updates, keeping acs-main customizations"

# Verify important files are intact
ls src/svg/  # Check logo files
git log --oneline -5  # Review merge history
```

### Merge Strategy Philosophy
- **ACS customizations take precedence**: Logo, branding, chemistry-specific features
- **Accept beneficial upstream updates**: Package versions, security updates, new features
- **Conservative approach**: Always create backups, resolve conflicts manually
- **Visual tools**: Use Zed's Project Diff for clear conflict resolution
- **Package manager**: acs-main uses **pnpm** for better performance and disk efficiency

### Embeddable Component Architecture
This starter is configured to be **embedded into larger websites** without style conflicts:

- **Minimal `<head>` tags**: The `app.html` head section contains only `%sveltekit.head%` to avoid conflicts with parent site metadata
- **Scoped CSS architecture**: All styles are scoped to `#story` container to prevent bleeding into parent sites
- **Component wrapper**: Uses `<div id="content">` instead of `<main>` in `+layout.svelte` for flexibility
- **Optional metadata**: `Meta.svelte` component is available but commented out by default in `+page.svelte`

#### Embedding Workflow
1. **Build your component**: Develop as normal with `npm run dev`
2. **Build for production**: Run `npm run build` to generate static files
3. **Extract component**: The built component can be injected into any parent site
4. **Style isolation**: The `#story` container ensures no style conflicts with parent site

### Scoped CSS System
Located in `src/styles/`:

```
scoped.css              # Main scoped stylesheet (import this in +layout.svelte)
├── variables.css       # CSS custom properties (colors, spacing, etc.)
├── font.css            # Font declarations
├── normalize-scoped.css # Browser normalization scoped to #story
└── reset-scoped.css    # CSS reset scoped to #story
```

#### Architecture Details

**Container Styles** (`#story`)
- High specificity to establish inheritance
- Sets typography, colors, and base styling
- Contains CSS custom properties for component theming

```css
#story {
	background-color: var(--color-bg, white);
	color: var(--color-fg, black);
	line-height: 1.4;
	font-family: var(--font-body, Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif);
	/* ... CSS variables defined here ... */
}
```

**Descendant Styles** (`:where(#story)`)
- Zero specificity using `:where()` pseudo-class
- Easily overridden by your component styles
- Prevents conflicts with parent site
- Includes form elements, buttons, tables, accessibility classes

```css
:where(#story) button {
	/* Styles easily overridden by your components */
}
```
#### Why This Matters

**Problem**: Embedding components in other sites causes style conflicts
- Global resets affect parent site
- Parent site styles override your component
- Specificity wars and `!important` overuse

**Solution**: Scoped CSS with strategic specificity
- ✅ Container (`#story`) establishes inheritance
- ✅ Descendants (`:where()`) are easily customizable
- ✅ Zero impact on parent site
- ✅ No style bleeding in either direction

## About the Original Pudding Template

# Svelte Starter

**NOTE**: This uses Svelte 5 and is under active migration (not all features will work). For the less adventurous, use the [previous version](https://github.com/the-pudding/svelte-starter) (with Svelte 4).

This [starter template](https://github.com/the-pudding/svelte-starter) aims to quickly scaffold a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) project, designed around data-driven, visual stories at [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool).

### Notes
* _Do not use or reproduce The Pudding logos or fonts without written permission._
* _Prettier Formatting: Disable any text editor Prettier extensions to take advantage of the built-in rules._

### Features

- [ArchieML](http://archieml.org/) for micro-CMS powered by Google Docs and Sheets
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) for simple/easy svg icons
- [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/) for CSS/JS style parity
- [Runed](https://runed.dev/docs) for svelte5 rune utilities
- CSV, JSON, and SVG imports
- SSR static-hosted builds by default

## Quickstart
#### From Scratch
* Click the green `Use this template` button above.
* Alternatively: `npx degit the-pudding/svelte-starter my-project`

#### Pre-existing Project
* clone the repo

#### Installation
* In your local repo run `pnpm install` or `npm install`

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Change the script in `package.json` to `"dev": "svelte-kit dev --host"` to test on your local network on a different device.

## Deploy
Check out the `Makefile` for specific tasks.

### Staging (on Github)
```bash
npm run staging
```

### Production (on AWS for pudding.cool)
```bash
npm run prodution
```

### Manual
```bash
npm run build
```
This generates a directory called `build` with the statically rendered app.

### Password-Protected
To create a password-protected build:

Make sure you have a `.env` file in your root with a value of `PASSWORD=yourpassword`
```bash
make protect
```

Then run either `make github` or `make pudding`.

## Style

There are a few stylesheets included by default in `src/styles`. Refer to them in `app.css`, the place for applying global styles.

For variable parity in both CSS and JS, modify files in the `properties` folder using the [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/) API.

Run `npm run style` to regenerate the style dictionary.

#### Some css utility classes in reset.css
* `.sr-only`: makes content invisible available for screen reader
* `.text-outline`: adds a psuedo stroke to text element

### Custom Fonts
For locally hosted fonts, simply add the font to the `static/assets` folder and include a reference in `src/styles/font.css`, making sure the url starts with `"assets/..."`.

## Google Docs and Sheets

* Create a Google Doc or Sheet
* Click `Share` -> `Advanced` -> `Change...` -> `Anyone with this link`
* In the address bar, grab the ID - eg. "...com/document/d/**1IiA5a5iCjbjOYvZVgPcjGzMy5PyfCzpPF-LnQdCdFI0**/edit"
* paste in the ID above into `google.config.js`, and set the filepath to where you want the file saved
* If you want to do a Google Sheet, be sure to include the `gid` value in the url as well

Running `npm run gdoc` at any point (even in new tab while server is running) will fetch the latest from all Docs and Sheets.

## Structural Overview

### Pages
The `src/routes` directory contains pages for your app. For a single-page app (most cases) you don't have to modify anything in here. `+page.svelte` represents the root page, think of it as the `index.html` file. It is prepopulated with a few things like metadata and font preloading. It also includes a reference to a blank slate component `src/components/Index.svelte`. This is the file you want to really start in for your app.

### Embedding Data
For smaller datasets, it is often great to embed the data into the HTML file. If you want to use data as-is, you can use normal import syntax (e.g., `import data from "$data/file.csv"`). If you are working with data but you want to preserve the original or clean/parse just what you need to use in the browser to optimize the front-end payload, you can load it via `+page.server.js`, do some work on it, and return just what you need. This is passed automatically to `+page.svelte` and accessible in any component with `getContext("data")`.

## Tips

### Image asset paths
For `img` tags, use relative paths:

```html
<img src="assets/demo/test.jpg" />
```

or use `base` if on a sub route:

```html
<script>
	import { base } from "$app/paths";
</script>

<img src="{base}/assets/demo/test.jpg"  />
```

For CSS background images, use absolute paths:

```css
background: url("/assets/demo/test.jpg");
```

View example code in the preloaded demo.
